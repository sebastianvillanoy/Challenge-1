# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
<br>
The study looked at a Kickstarter dataset of 4115 crowdfunding campaigns. It was used to analyze the effect of launch dates and funding goals on the outcomes of plays, a subcategory of theatre crowdfunding campaigns. 

The goal is to find specific factors that make crowdfunding campaigns for plays successful. 
This information will help Louise set up her own campaign for her play entitled, "Fever" which has an estimated budget of at least $10,000.
